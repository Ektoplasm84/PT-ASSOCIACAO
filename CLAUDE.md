## What This Project Is

A Node.js membership management web app for a Portuguese-Taiwanese association. SQLite embedded database, EJS templates, Bootstrap 5. Deployed on **HostArmada shared cPanel hosting**.

Permission is controlled by two columns: `users.role` (`super_admin` / `admin` / `member`) and `users.position` (association title — `gestao` is the only position that grants extra access). See § Role System below.

---

## Dev Commands

```powershell
# Start server (PowerShell)
node app.js

# Kill stale node process before restart
Get-Process node | Stop-Process -Force

# Install dependencies (run on server after deploy too)
npm install
```

Server runs on `http://localhost:3000`. Default login: `admin@associacao.pt` / `admin1234` (role: `super_admin`).

### cPanel deploy workflow (HostArmada / LiteSpeed)

LiteSpeed's `lsnode` process manager does not always terminate cleanly when you click "Stop" — the old process can be orphaned (PPID=1) and keep serving stale code. Always kill it explicitly:

1. `git pull` in the app directory on the server
2. Check PID: `https://associacao.poetico.co/node-check.php?token=ptassoc-diag-2024`
3. Kill it: `https://associacao.poetico.co/node-kill.php?token=ptassoc-diag-2024&pid=XXXX`
4. cPanel → Node.js Selector → **Start**

`node-check.php` and `node-kill.php` are gitignored — upload manually to `public_html/` only when needed, delete after use. The PID changes on every restart; always check before killing.

## File Map

```
app.js                   Entry point — middleware, sessions, routes, .env loader
                         Sets `app.set('trust proxy', 1)` before session middleware (required for cPanel nginx + Secure cookie)
                         Mounts authenticated photo/thumb routes (see § Hard Rules)
                         Mounts public vault routes: GET /vault, GET /vault/files/:id (requireAuth)
                         GET /lang/:code — sets lang cookie; redirects to same-origin Referer only (validated + normalized)
database/db.js           SQLite schema, migrations, seed admin
routes/auth.js           /login, /logout
routes/admin.js          /admin/* — member CRUD, documents, card OCR, NIA photo fetch,
                         role change, password reset, audit log, OCR health check,
                         settings (fee + models + timeout), calendar events, vault (upload/download/delete)
                         getSetting(key, default) / setSetting(key, value) helpers for settings table.
                         Loads persisted OCR model list + timeout from settings at module init.
                         resolveAudience(groups) → single UNION query → array of user IDs.
                         isManagementUser(u) → true if user.position is in MGMT_POSITIONS.
                         calendarWriteGuard — allows admin+ and all MGMT_POSITIONS.
                         canUploadVault(user) → true for admin/SA/all management positions.
                         contentDispositionFilename(disposition, name) — RFC 5987 Content-Disposition helper.
                         fixFilename(name) — re-encodes multer/busboy latin1 filenames to UTF-8 for Chinese support.
                         MODEL_ID_RE — regex `/^[a-zA-Z0-9_\-/:\.]{1,120}$/` validates OCR model IDs.
                         _testCooldowns — Map enforcing 10-second per-model cooldown on ocr-test-model.
routes/user.js           /profile/* — own profile (single-scroll: profile grid + notifications + public vault),
                         invite respond, iCal export
                         Profile GET queries vault_files WHERE section='public' and passes vaultFiles[] to render.
                         Exports: { router, contentDispositionFilename } (NOT a default export)
middleware/auth.js       requireAuth, requireAdmin, requireSuperAdmin, requireViewAll guards
                         requireAuth also sets res.locals.pendingInviteCount (pending invite count)
utils/fee.js             computeFeeStatus(fee_amount, fee_last_paid)
utils/ocr.js             OpenRouter vision API — dual-model parallel scan

                         Exports: scan(docType, imagePath), checkModels(),
                                  getModelWarnings(), dismissModelWarning(model),
                                  getActiveModels(), setActiveModels(models),
                                  testModel(modelId),

utils/taiwan-districts.js All 22 TW cities/counties + districts (ZH/EN/postal)
utils/i18n.js            Zero-dependency i18n middleware — reads `lang` cookie from raw headers,
                         caches JSON locale files, attaches t(dot.notation.key) + lang to res.locals.
                         Supported: en / pt / zh-TW (default: en). No npm dependencies (fs + path only).

## Hard Rules

- **`frontend/`** is Claude Design territory — keep logic out of templates, keep markup out of routes
- **Never set `fee_status` or `fee_valid_until` from a form** — always computed by `utils/fee.js`
- **Use `bcryptjs`**, not `bcrypt` — pure JS, required for shared hosting (no native compile)
- **All file paths** must use `process.cwd()` not `__dirname` — cPanel working directory differs
- **No Puppeteer / Chromium** — shared hosting has none; use server-side `fetch` instead
- **Node 18+** required — NIA photo fetch uses global `fetch`
- **Multi-statement SQLite DDL**: do not use `db.exec` with multiple statements — use a loop of `db.prepare(sql).run()` calls (security hook blocks the other form)
- **Do not upload** `node_modules/`, `uploads/`, `database/data.db`, or **`.env`** to cPanel
- **`.env` must never be committed or uploaded** — `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` and `SESSION_SECRET` are in `.env`; on cPanel set them as environment variables in the Node.js App panel
- **`.env.example`** is safe to commit — it contains no real values, only placeholders
- **Bootstrap modal init** — never call `new bootstrap.Modal(...)` at script parse time; use a lazy getter so instantiation is deferred until after `footer.ejs` loads Bootstrap JS
- **Photos and thumbs are NOT static** — served through authenticated `app.get('/uploads/photos/:filename')` and `app.get('/uploads/thumbs/:filename')` routes in `app.js`. Do not add `express.static` for these paths.
- **`app.set('trust proxy', 1)` must be set** before session middleware in `app.js`; required for HTTPS `Secure` cookies behind cPanel's nginx reverse proxy. Also set `NODE_ENV=production` in the cPanel Node.js App environment variables panel.
- **`fee_amount = 0` is valid** — always use `parseInt(fee_amount, 10) >= 0 ? parseInt(fee_amount, 10) : 300` (not `|| 300`) so honorary members' zero fee is stored correctly.
- **Document Content-Disposition** — use `contentDispositionFilename(disposition, name)` helper (RFC 5987) in both admin.js and user.js for any `Content-Disposition` header; `res.download()` is not used.
- **Chinese / non-ASCII filenames** — always wrap `req.file.originalname` with `fixFilename(name)` before storing in the DB; busboy 1.x decodes multipart filenames as latin1 by default, so raw UTF-8 bytes from modern browsers come in garbled. `fixFilename` does `Buffer.from(name, 'latin1').toString('utf8')`.
- **`routes/user.js` exports an object** — `const { router: userRouter, contentDispositionFilename } = require('./routes/user')`; it does NOT export the router as a plain default. Do not revert to `module.exports = router`.
- **Vault files are NOT static** — served via authenticated routes in `app.js` (`GET /vault/files/:id` for public, `GET /admin/vault/files/:id` for admin). Do not add `express.static` for `uploads/vault/`.
- **Vault routes live in `app.js`, not `user.js`** — mounting the userRouter at `/vault` would double the prefix (user.js route `/vault` + mount `/vault` = `/vault/vault`). The two member-facing vault routes are defined directly in `app.js`.
- **NIA fetch is blocked for APRC and TW Passport** — `is_aprc=1` or `is_tw_passport=1` members do not have a searchable NIA ARC record; the captcha and fetch routes return a clear message and do not call NIA.
- **`is_aprc` and `is_tw_passport` are mutually exclusive** — derived server-side from the `residence_doc_type` radio value (`arc` / `aprc` / `tw_passport`); never both 1 at the same time.
- **OCR model timeout is runtime-configurable** — `MODEL_TIMEOUT_MS` in `ocr.js` is a `let`, not a `const`; changed via `setModelTimeout(ms)`. Persisted as `ocr_timeout_ms` in the settings table. AbortController cleared only after `res.json()` completes — do NOT clear it after `await fetch()` headers arrive.
- **i18n: `t()` is available in every EJS template** — provided by `utils/i18n.js` via `res.locals`. Call `t('section.key')` with dot notation. Falls back to the key string itself if missing — never throws.
- **i18n: `locales/en.json` is the source of truth** — add new UI strings there first, then copy and translate into `pt.json` and `zh-TW.json`. All three files must have the same key structure.
- **i18n: ZH-TW is AI-generated** — `locales/zh-TW.json` contains a `_note` warning key. Do not ship Chinese UI as production-ready without native speaker review.
- **i18n: `/lang/:code` redirect is hardened** — Referer header is validated same-origin; pathname is normalized (strip leading slashes, re-prefix one); redirect uses absolute same-origin URL (`${req.protocol}://${req.headers.host}${safePath}`). Never revert to `res.redirect(req.headers.referer)`.
- **`npm install` not needed for i18n changes** — `utils/i18n.js` and `locales/*.json` have zero npm dependencies. Only run `npm install` on the server when `package.json` changes.

## Role System

Two independent columns on `users`: `role` (permission) and `position` (association title).

### `users.role` — system permissions
| Role | Access |
|------|--------|
| `super_admin` | Full access: everything including role/position changes and deleting any account |
| `admin` | All member CRUD, documents, OCR, NIA photo, audit log — cannot change roles |
| `member` | Own profile only — view + edit own data, download own documents |

### `users.position` — association title (display + one access rule)
| Position | Notes |
|----------|-------|
| `member` | Default |
| `honorary` | No fees; fee sections show N/A; excluded from paid/unpaid dashboard stats |
| `gestao` | Umbrella for all management positions — grants view-all + fee-write access |
| `board` / `president` / `treasurer` / `secretary` | Sub-positions under the gestao umbrella — same view-all + fee-write access as gestao |

### Middleware (`middleware/auth.js`)
- `requireAuth` — any logged-in user; sets `res.locals.currentUser`, `res.locals.canWrite`, `res.locals.isSuperAdmin`, `res.locals.canViewAll`
- `requireViewAll` — `role IN (super_admin,admin)` OR `position = 'gestao'`; used at admin router mount
- `requireAdmin` — `super_admin | admin`; available for inline use
- `requireSuperAdmin` — `super_admin` only; available for inline use

### `res.locals` helpers (available in every authenticated view)
- `canWrite` — `true` for `super_admin` and `admin`; hides all write controls
- `isSuperAdmin` — `true` for `super_admin` only; shows Role Management panel on member-detail
- `canViewAll` — `true` for admin+ OR position=gestao
- `pendingInviteCount` — integer count of pending event invites for the current user; drives the topbar bell badge

### Inline guards in `routes/admin.js`
- `adminOnly(req, res, next)` — blocks gestao (position) on all write routes
- `superAdminOnly(req, res, next)` — blocks everyone except `super_admin` on role-change and password-reset routes

### Role/Position Change Route
`POST /admin/members/:id/change-role` — super_admin only; validates role from `['super_admin','admin','member']`, updates both `users.role` and `users.position`.

### Password Reset Route
`POST /admin/members/:id/set-password` — super_admin only; body `{ new_password, confirm_password }`; min 6 chars validated server-side; hashed with `bcryptjs` cost 10; audited as `member.password_reset`.

### DB Migrations (startup)
1. `super_admin` absent from users SQL → recreate table: `admin→super_admin`, `user→member`
2. `position` absent from users SQL → recreate table: old `gestao` role → `role=member, position=gestao`

---

## Key Behaviours to Preserve

- Member CRUD is wrapped in `db.transaction()` — user row + member row created/deleted atomically
- Document downloads go through authenticated routes (ownership verified) — files are NOT served statically
- Sessions persist in SQLite via `better-sqlite3-session-store` — survive server restarts
- `nextMemberId()` reads the last member_id and increments — format is `ASSOC-XXXX` (zero-padded 4 digits); called **inside** the create transaction
- All user-facing queries in `routes/user.js` scope to `WHERE user_id = req.session.userId` — never trust URL params for ownership
- Card documents are one-per-type per member (`arc_front`, `arc_back`, `cc_front`, `cc_back`) — uploading a new one deletes the previous file + DB row for that type
- OCR fields applied via `apply-card-fields` are validated against an ALLOWED list — no freeform field writes
- Display name throughout app: `arc_name_en || (first_name + ' ' + last_name)`
- **Audit log is append-only** — never add UPDATE or DELETE routes for `audit_log`; call `writeAudit()` from `utils/audit.js` after every write action on member data
- **Fee status for honorary members** — never compute fee status for `position='honorary'`; their fee sections show N/A and they are excluded from paid/unpaid dashboard counts
- **Login rate limiting** lives in-memory in `routes/auth.js` — it resets on server restart by design (shared hosting); do not persist to DB
- **New member placeholder credentials** — `GET /admin/members/new` pre-fills `email=membro.XXXX@associacao.pt`, `first_name=Novo`, `last_name=Membro XXXX` (random 4-char suffix). Admin can override before saving. Email is the login identifier — changing it immediately changes what the member uses to log in.
- **Fee dropdown in `member-form.ejs`** is dynamic — shows the member's actual stored fee amount (non-zero) or falls back to the `defaultFee` local for new members. `defaultFee` must be passed to `res.render()` for both new and edit routes — including validation re-renders on error.
- **Calendar events** — created by admin/SA/gestao via dashboard modal; `resolveAudience()` in `routes/admin.js` converts audience group strings to user IDs via a single UNION query; invites inserted in the same transaction as the event; `end_date` must be ≥ `start_date` (validated server-side); `GET /admin/events/:id/invites` requires `adminOnly` guard (not just viewAll)
- **Notification bell** — `pendingInviteCount` set in `requireAuth` on every request; topbar bell links to `/profile#notifications`; member profile is single-scroll — `id="notifications"` anchor scrolls directly to that section; no tabs, no `activeTab` local
- **iCal export** — `GET /profile/invites/:id/export.ics`; RFC 5545 plain text, no library needed; DTEND is always start+1 day for single-day events (iCal all-day exclusive end); ownership verified against `req.session.userId`
- **Event location is plain text** — no geocoding; WIP: render as `maps.google.com/?q=` link in templates
- **Fee label for honorary/exempt members** — displays as "Honorary Member" everywhere: fee badge fallback in `feeBadge()`, inline status text in member-detail, fee_amount display in member-detail and profile, dropdown options ("0 TWD — Honorary Member"). Never shows "0 TWD (Exempt)".
- **Members list Position column** — shows system role when elevated: `super_admin` → "Super Admin" (gold badge), `admin` → "Admin" (info badge); falls back to association position for regular members. The list query selects `u.role as user_role` alongside `u.position`.
- **Admin password reset** — super_admin can set a new password for any member via the password reset form in the Account Settings card on member-detail. Client-side: mismatch alert + confirm dialog. Server-side: min 6 chars + mismatch check + bcrypt hash + audit log.
- **Fee reminder alert** — shown once at the top of `user/profile.ejs` (tabs removed in DS R4); visible regardless of scroll position.
- **Profile page restructure (DS R4)** — `user/profile.ejs` removed Bootstrap tabs entirely; layout is `profile-layout` CSS grid (`.profile-sidebar` + `.profile-cards`); notifications section uses `id="notifications"` anchor; public vault files appended at the bottom as a `pta-table-wrap` table; `routes/user.js` profile GET now queries `vault_files WHERE section='public'` and passes `vaultFiles` to render.
- **Notes card on member profile** — gated by `canWrite && member.notes` (not `currentUser.role === 'admin'`); super_admin users also see notes.
- **Calendar event indicators** — dashboard calendar cells use `.pta-cal-strip` (colored titled strips, not dots); up to 2 strips stacked per day; colors assigned by `CAL_COLORS[event.id % 8]`; "+N more" strip when >2 events. Cells with events get `.has-events` class (light blue tint, bold number). "New Event" button in dashboard is guarded for `canWrite` OR management positions. On mobile (≤640px) `renderAgendaMobile()` builds a `.pta-agenda` list view from `_calEvents` grouped by day; clicking an item calls `selectDay()`.
- **NIA fetch-error retry** — when the NIA photo fetch fails, a "Try again" button is shown in `member-detail.ejs` that re-runs `loadCaptcha()` without a page reload.
- **NIA fetch blocked for APRC/TW Passport** — `is_aprc=1` or `is_tw_passport=1` members show an info note instead of the fetch button; the captcha and fetch routes also check and return a descriptive error if called directly.
- **File Vault** — Public Vault: any logged-in member can view/download; admin/SA/management can upload. Administration Vault: admin/SA only. Delete: admin/SA only. Upload and delete are audited. Max 20 MB per file; allowed: PDF, images, Word, Excel, plain text.
- **Members list Warnings column** — computed client-side from `m.arc_expiry_date`, `m.cc_expiry_date`, and `m.is_aprc`; APRC members skip the ARC expiry check. Multiple badges can stack in one cell. "No Warning" badge (success) when no issues.
- **Members list ID Type column** — shows ARC / APRC (info tone) / TW Passport based on `is_aprc` and `is_tw_passport` flags.
- **ARC name hint on edit form** — `member-form.ejs` shows a blue info banner with a "Use ARC name" button when `arc_name_en` differs from `first_name + last_name`; values are in `data-arc-first`/`data-arc-last` HTML attributes (EJS HTML-escapes them); JS reads via `this.dataset.*` — never interpolated into JS source. Splits on last whitespace: last word → Last Name, remainder → First Name.
- **ARC section is now 3-way** — `member-form.ejs` uses `.pta-seg` (DS segmented control) with `btn-check` radio inputs (`residence_doc_type`: `arc` / `aprc` / `tw_passport`); icons: `bi-credit-card-fill` / `bi-shield-fill-check` / `bi-passport-fill`; APRC label has no "(Permanent)" suffix — implied by name; `arcDocTypeChanged()` JS toggles expiry label, passport label, and APRC permanent badge; server derives `is_aprc` and `is_tw_passport` from this single field.
- **Members list sort** — `sort` param driven by a server-side `SORT_MAP` whitelist; `memberListUrl(overrides)` helper in the template builds URLs preserving all active filters. Defensive fallback `var sort = (typeof sort !== 'undefined') ? sort : 'name_az'` at top of template guards against old cached routes.
- **Vault confirm dialog XSS** — delete forms use `data-name="<%= f.original_name %>"` (EJS auto-escapes) + `this.dataset.name` in `onsubmit`; never interpolate user-controlled text directly into a JS event handler attribute.
- **File Vault audit** — `vault.upload` and `vault.delete` action keys; detail includes section + filename + size. Both called via `writeAudit()` from `utils/audit.js` in the vault routes.
- **Language switcher** — `GET /lang/:code` sets `lang` cookie (365 days, `httpOnly:false`, `sameSite:lax`); redirect is validated same-origin with normalized path; `utils/i18n.js` reads cookie from raw headers on every request; supported codes: `en` / `pt` / `zh-TW`; default: `en`. Switcher shown in topbar (dark style) and login page (`.pta-langsw--light`).
- **`<html lang="">` attribute** — set from `res.locals.lang` in both `header.ejs` and `login.ejs`; enables `:lang(zh-TW)` CSS rule that applies CJK font stack.

## Adding DB Columns

Simple addition (no constraint change):
```javascript
const cols = db.prepare('PRAGMA table_info(members)').all().map(c => c.name);
if (!cols.includes('new_col')) {
  db.prepare('ALTER TABLE members ADD COLUMN new_col TEXT').run();
}
```

Constraint change (requires full table recreation — see PROJECT.md § SQLite Migration Patterns).

---

## Card OCR

Implemented in `utils/ocr.js`. No OCR library — pure HTTPS call to OpenRouter vision API.

```javascript
const { scan } = require('../utils/ocr');
const extracted = await scan('arc_front', '/abs/path/to/image.jpg');
// → { arc_number: '...', arc_name_en: '...', address_zh: '...', ... }
// If the two models disagreed on a field:
// → { ..., _conflicts: { arc_name_en: ['valA', 'valB'] } }
```

Four doc types: `arc_front`, `arc_back`, `cc_front`, `cc_back`. Each has a distinct prompt in `PROMPTS`.

### Dual-model parallel execution
The first two active models run **in parallel**. Their results are merged:
- First non-empty value wins for each field
- If both return different non-empty values → field recorded in `_conflicts: { field: [valA, valB] }`
- If either is rate-limited (429), the third model is substituted as fallback

### Active model list (runtime-configurable)
The list lives in `_activeModels` inside `ocr.js`. On startup, `routes/admin.js` reads `ocr_models` from the `settings` table and calls `setActiveModels()`. If no setting exists, the hardcoded `DEFAULT_VISION_MODELS` is used:

1. `nvidia/nemotron-nano-12b-v2-vl:free` — primary (fast, good results)
2. `nex-agi/nex-n2-pro:free` — secondary parallel
3. `moonshotai/kimi-k2.6:free` — fallback on 429

**Before adding or swapping a model**: verify the exact model ID is valid on OpenRouter. Wrong IDs cause HTTP 400 errors and surface as offline warnings in the dashboard.

`OPENROUTER_MODEL` env var pins a single model (bypasses parallel + fallback logic entirely).

### Model management (`super_admin` only)
```javascript
const { getActiveModels, setActiveModels, testModel } = require('../utils/ocr');
getActiveModels();              // returns current mutable list
setActiveModels(['id1','id2']); // replaces list; falls back to DEFAULT_VISION_MODELS if empty
                                // also clears stale modelStatus entries for removed models
await testModel('model/id');    // pings one model; returns { ok: bool, error?: string }
```
Dashboard "OCR Model Configuration" card shows current models with role labels (Primary / Secondary / Fallback), per-model Test and Remove buttons, Add Model input, and Save. `POST /admin/settings/models` persists the list.

Model IDs are validated against `MODEL_ID_RE = /^[a-zA-Z0-9_\-/:\.]{1,120}$/` on both the models-save and test routes. `POST /admin/ocr-test-model` enforces a 10-second per-model cooldown via `_testCooldowns` Map.

### Post-processing
- `arc_serial_number`: spaces stripped (models hallucinate a space between letter prefix and digits)
- `arc_name_en`: prompts instruct models to reorder from ARC SURNAME-FIRST format to Western GIVEN-FIRST

### Model health (`super_admin` only)
```javascript
const { checkModels, getModelWarnings, dismissModelWarning } = require('../utils/ocr');
await checkModels();           // pings all active models, updates in-memory modelStatus
getModelWarnings();            // returns current warnings array
dismissModelWarning(modelId);  // clears a warning from memory
```
Failures detected passively during scans (non-429 errors) also populate `modelStatus`.
Dashboard shows a "Vision Model Health" card (super_admin only).

### OCR Review Modal conflicts
When `_conflicts` is present in `extracted`, the modal shows a `<select>` dropdown for each conflicted field (Model A vs Model B) instead of a static value. The checkbox's `data-value` updates live when the admin picks.

Routes in `routes/admin.js`:
- `POST /admin/members/:id/documents/card` — upload image, auto-OCR, return `{ extracted }` JSON
- `POST /admin/members/:id/documents/:docId/ocr` — re-run OCR on stored card
- `POST /admin/members/:id/apply-card-fields` — write checked fields to member record
- `POST /admin/ocr-health-check` — super_admin only; pings all active models, returns `{ warnings }`
- `POST /admin/ocr-dismiss-warning` — super_admin only; body `{ model }`, clears in-memory warning
- `POST /admin/ocr-test-model` — super_admin only; body `{ model }`, returns `{ ok, error? }` JSON

## App Settings

Runtime-configurable values stored in the `settings` table (key/value). Read/write via helpers in `routes/admin.js`:

```javascript
getSetting('default_fee_amount', '300')   // → string or defaultVal if key absent
setSetting('default_fee_amount', '400')   // → upserts row
```

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|-----|------|---------|-------------|
| `default_fee_amount` | integer string | `'300'` | Annual fee (TWD) pre-filled on new member forms; saving also retroactively updates all unpaid non-honorary members |
| `ocr_models` | JSON array string | (none — uses hardcoded) | Active OCR model list |
| `ocr_timeout_ms` | integer string | (none — uses 55000) | Per-model timeout in ms (10000–120000); configurable from OCR Model Configuration card |

Super-admin dashboard cards for both settings:
- **Default Annual Fee** card — number input + Save → `POST /admin/settings/fee`
- **OCR Model Configuration** card — ordered list, add/remove/test → `POST /admin/settings/models`

Changing the fee also retroactively updates `fee_amount` for all members where `fee_status = 'unpaid'` and `position != 'honorary'`.

See PROJECT.md § Card OCR Feature for full details including prompt notes.

## NIA ARC Photo Fetch

Server-side only (no browser automation). Routes in `routes/admin.js`:
- `GET /admin/members/:id/arc-captcha` — fetches captcha image from NIA, stores JSESSIONID, returns base64 to browser
- `POST /admin/members/:id/arc-fetch-photo` — validates captcha with NIA, calls search, saves returned photo

The **Fetch NIA Photo** button lives in the sidebar profile card under the member's photo (not in the ARC section). If the fetch fails, a "Try again" button appears that re-invokes `loadCaptcha()` without a page reload.

See PROJECT.md § NIA ARC Photo Fetch for full API details.

## Address Fields

Address is stored as two plain text fields — no dropdown picker needed:
- `address_zh` — Chinese address as printed on the ARC card (auto-filled by OCR scan of `arc_front`)
- `address` — English address

Both are simple `<input type="text">` fields in `member-form.ejs` and `profile-edit.ejs`. The old `address-field.ejs` partial (Taiwan/Other cascading dropdown) still exists on disk but is no longer used.

## Design System

The PT Design System is a set of CSS files that sit on top of Bootstrap 5. **Never revert or bypass it.**

### Load order (must be preserved)
```html
Bootstrap 5 CSS (CDN)
Bootstrap Icons (CDN)
Flag Icons (CDN)
/css/custom.css           (Bootstrap minor overrides)
/css/ds/pt-design-system.css   (design tokens + .pta-* components)
/css/ds/pt-bootstrap-bridge.css (remaps Bootstrap variables to design tokens)
```

### Layout structure (all authenticated pages)
```
header.ejs  →  <header class="pta-topbar"> ... </header>
              <main class="pta-main">
                <%- include('flash') %>

### Topbar & brand (DS R4)
- Background: `#313131` charcoal — set via `.pta-topbar { background: #313131; }` override at end of `pt-design-system.css` (not via the `--surface-inverse` token, to avoid breaking other uses)
- Brand name: `<span class="pta-brand__name">Associação Cultural Portuguesa</span>` / `<span class="pta-brand__sub">na Formosa</span>`
- Emblem: `logo-emblem.png` (512×512, copper on charcoal) — **not** `.svg`; reference in `header.ejs` and `login.ejs`
- Member-only nav (non-canViewAll) shows only "My Profile"; Documents link is in the admin/gestao nav only

### SRI hashes
All CDN links in `header.ejs`, `footer.ejs`, and `login.ejs` have `integrity` attributes. If a CDN version is ever bumped, recompute the hash locally:
```powershell
$bytes = (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadData('https://...')
'sha384-' + [Convert]::ToBase64String([Security.Cryptography.SHA384]::Create().ComputeHash($bytes))
```
